# Colorado Election Analysis
## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections employee gave me the following tasks to complete an election audit of a recent local congressional election.
1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received. 
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the lection based on popular vote. 

## Resources
- Data source: election_results.csv
- Software: Python 3.6.1, Visual Studio Code, 1.38.1

## Summary
Here are the results based on my analysis that were outputted to a text file:

## Challenge Overview
The election commission requested some additional data to complete the audit:

- The voter turnout for each county
- The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
- The county with the highest turnout

This was to be printed to the terminal output and written to my analysis text file. 

## Challenge Summary
I replicated similar methods that I used in the initial assignment to this challenge. A few problems I ran into were some minor indentation issues, syntax errors, and had some trouble formatting the output to appear the way that I wanted it too. In the end, the county turnout challenge was added successfully to the audit as seen below.

## Election Audit Summary
This script is very versatile and can easily be used to handle other election audits in the state of Colorado. This was used for a local election, but it could be modified to handle any size election from a small discrict race to a large statewide election.
